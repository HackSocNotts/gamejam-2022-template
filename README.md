# HackSoc Game Jam 2022 Submission Template

Welcome to HackSoc's 2022 Game Jam! To make it easier to look at and judge all
of the submitted games, we ask that you have a modified version of this file in
the root of your submission folder.

Feel free to add things to your template, but try to keep the subheadings that
are already there. You could add things like images and links to videos.

*For your modified version of this file, feel free to delete everything above and including this paragraph, as it's just instruction for you.*

# "Your Game Title"
## By "Your Team Name"
## Game Jam Theme: **'Proportion'**

*Put a screenshot of your game here, if you want.*

### Description

*Write a brief (or in depth, up to you) description of your game here. Don't worry about spending too much time writing this, scoring will be based on the game itself, not this document - this is just to give us an overview of what your project is.*

### Running Instructions

*Here you can explain how we can run your game. Ideally, list which OS's it can run on. If you don't provide a pre-built binary, explain how we can compile it. We're fine with installing libraries and stuff to get your game working, but please don't just give us a whole big Unreal Engine project, for example :)*

### How To Play

*Explain to us how, once your game's running, we play it. Just briefly - we'll probably be able to figure it out either way.*
